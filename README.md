# CurseGradle - Updated

# Maintenance of this plugin has been dropped in favor of [modpublisher](https://github.com/firstdarkdev/modpublisher). Please use that instead, as it's much more updated, much more stable and has a lot more features.



[![Build Status](https://ci.explodingcreeper.me/buildStatus/icon?job=CurseGradle)](https://ci.explodingcreeper.me/view/HypherionMC's%20Projects/job/CurseGradle/)

An updated fork of the CurseGradle gradle plugin for publishing artifacts to [CurseForge](https://curseforge.com/).

This project was originally created by Matthew Prenger, but hasn't been updated since 2020. I intend to keep this plugin up to date, as well as add new features
